Eunice MacGillivray, class of 1931
""Eunice was quite a character.  She lived to 95 and outlived
just about all her friends, and was in the habit of telling many
priests in her lifetime exactly what to do. After MSVU she
went on the stage in Saint John N.B., toured the country in
shows, got married around age 35 to an airman from Halifax,
who was related to John Murphy the mayor.   She lived in many
cities because of her husband, and finally ended up in Montreal
after they both retired. And that is where I met their daughter
Mary Jo in 1986, just 400 yds away from my house.""  -From an e-mail written to the Archives by Alan Whitbread","","","","","Eunice Lanigan (nee MacGuillivray)","","","",""
